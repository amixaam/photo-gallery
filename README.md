# Photo gallery
This is my photo gallery!

I made this with React as the frontend and Laravel as the backend!
This was meant for practice and oh boy did i sure get some practice..

There's a Vercel link for it, but you won't get much out of it, since you need laravel for it and they don't support that from what i know.
